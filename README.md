# My personal settings
These are the common settings I use daily.
Feel free to use any of them.


# Features
- Bash (may be deprecated since I mostly use zsh)
- Editorconfig
- Git
- i3
- terminator (may be deprecated since I mostly use urxvt)
- urxvt (see the last line of file `config` to understand how to use themes)
- vim (place the plugins in `.config/nvim/plugged`, then use the tool `Plug`)
- vscode
- xinit
- zsh


# Sync
To synchronize the local settings with this folder, I use `coco-setting-manager`.
It's a simple script to create symlinks according to a config file
(https://github.com/GeekyMoose/coco-settings-manager).
