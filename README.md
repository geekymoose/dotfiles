# My personal settings

These are the common settings I use daily.
Feel free to use any of them.

## Features

- Bash (may be deprecated since I mostly use zsh)
- Editorconfig
- Git
- i3
- Terminator (may be deprecated since I mostly use urxvt)
- urxvt (see the last line of file `config` to understand how to use themes)
- Vim (place the plugins in `.config/nvim/plugged`, then use the tool `Plug`)
- Vscode
- Xinit
- Zsh

## Sync

To synchronize the local settings with this folder, I use `coco-setting-manager`.
It's a simple script to create symlinks according to a config file
(<https://github.com/GeekyMoose/coco-settings-manager>).
