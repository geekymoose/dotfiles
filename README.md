# My personal settings
These are the settings I'm using daily.
Feel free to use any of them (Or any part of it).


# Features
- Bash (May be old, I'm using zsh instead)
- Editorconfig
- i3
- terminator (May be old, I'm using urxvt mostly)
- urxvt (See last line of file `config` to understand how to use themes)
- vim (Uses Plug. Place plugins in `.config/nvim/plugged`)
- vscode
- xinit
- xsh


# Sync
To synchronize local settings with this folder, I'm using `coco-setting-manager`.
It's a simple script I wrote to create symlinks according to a config file.
